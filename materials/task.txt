Hi Ghelo,


Import these 2 CSV files into Odoo 8 as follows:

* customize Odoo in order to accommodate the data from the CSV files

* In Odoo, the user must be able to see the following:
- must be able to find a person by name or email
- must be able to see a list of all persons
- must be able to see a list of all apartments
- must be able to see which apartment(s) is(are) owned by a given person
- must be able to see the overall balance for a person
- must be able to see the total sum of sq. meters owned by a person

* transform these “plain” CSV files into “Odoo” CSV format, which can be directly imported. Use Python to write a separate tool (not part of Odoo), which just takes the CSV files as input and outputs “Odoo” CSV files, which are ready for direct import in Odoo.

* provide 2 levels of access in Odoo:
- a group of users who can see persons and apartments, but are not able to see balance info data.
- a group of users who can see persons, apartments, and balance info data

* use the built-in Odoo import functionality to import the necessary data from your transformed CSV files
